				<section>Specification by example  <br /> (a retrospective of 6 years usage)</section>
				<section>Start with sunny scenarios
					<aside class="notes">
						don't misunderstand me : we do to cover all the feature well.
						there is no value on superficial validation.
						we still some edge cases.
						we also need "Deep validation for complex cases".
						but no need for to put every case "a build with 30 min with every case on one of costumer"
						Transition -> let's be more specific
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>Only command scenarios
					<aside class="notes">
					the most rich business behavior is in the command side
					the querying still gives value but mostly restructuring data => waste of time in bdd.
					but queries still need to be to tested / implemented.
					we also need "Deep validation for complex cases"
					Transition -> to trigger a command you need an ... event !!!
				  </aside>
				</section>
				<section>use domain events in 'when' step
					<aside class="notes">
						I have discovered few workshops that can be helpful like event storming.
						the use of a event facilitates the when side : the only needed thing et to structure the event.
						Transition -> event also are used to trigger batch application
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>Don't do it with batch application
					<aside class="notes">
						- i worked on big company producing cars.
						- we had a guy who got excited about every new approach.
						- he said let's try it i did'nt like the idea but i didn't it before so i tried it.
						- batch app mostly don't have a rich business rules and business behavior.
						if that's the case do only on the small code with rich business rules / behavior.
						Transition -> who don't app without 'direct' business value.
